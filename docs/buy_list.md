That's the perfect question now that the safety component is on the way. To build a robust, modular, and reliable platform for imitation learning—especially since you plan to move to the **Jetson Nano** later—you need a few basic prototyping items.

The goal is to go from those delicate soldered wires to a sturdy, easily detachable harness.

Here is what I recommend ordering to complete your hardware interface setup:

## Essential Prototyping Gear

| Item | Why You Need It | Recommended Search Term (Amazon) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Breadboard** | This is your central hub. The level converter pins are too small for direct wiring, and the breadboard allows you to securely mount the converter and manage all the jumper connections cleanly. | `small breadboard 400 point` |
| **Male/Female Jumper Wires** | You will use the **Male ends** to plug into the Raspberry Pi $\text{GPIO}$ header and the breadboard. You will use **Female ends** to connect to the male header pins (see below). | `jumper wires male to female` |
| **Male Header Pins (2.54mm pitch)** | **Crucial for reliability.** You will solder 3 of these pins onto the ends of your delicate tap wires (Steering, Throttle, GND). This turns the loose wires into a plug that secures into the breadboard and jumper wires, preventing stress on your original PCB taps. | `male header pins 2.54mm` |
| **Small Zip Ties or Velcro** | Once the electronics are mounted, you need to manage the wires to prevent them from catching on the wheels or vibrating loose during driving. | `small velcro straps for electronics` |

## Why These Items are Necessary for Reliability

Since you've done excellent, precise work tapping the signals, we want to ensure that work lasts. The combination of the level converter and these items creates a robust connection:

1.  **Security (Header Pins):** Soldering header pins to your tap wires means you can plug and unplug the car's signal lines safely from the breadboard without stressing the original solder points on the integrated ESC/Receiver.
2.  **Modularity (Breadboard):** If you ever need to debug a signal or switch which RPi pin you're using, the breadboard makes it a 10-second change instead of a re-solder job.
3.  **Future-Proofing:** When you eventually swap the Raspberry Pi 5 for the **Jetson Nano**, all you do is unplug the jumpers from the RPi $\text{GPIO}$ and plug them into the Jetson's $\text{GPIO}$—no changes to the car's delicate wiring are needed.
