That is perfect\! Seeing the command line tells me two things:

1.  You are successfully logged into your **Raspberry Pi 5** via $\text{SSH}$ (likely using VS Code Remote $\text{SSH}$â€”the best way to work\!).
2.  You have successfully started the **`pigpiod`** daemon using `sudo pigpiod`.

**The RPi's high-speed timing service is now running, waiting to read your signals.**

The next step is to execute the Python script to confirm your new level converter wiring is working and that the RPi is correctly reading the $\text{PWM}$ signals from the car.

### Next Step: Run the Data Logging Script

You need to execute the `control_interface.py` file, specifically calling the `data_logging_example()` function.

1.  **Check the Wiring:** Double-check that your new **Logic Level Converter** is wired according to the last guide, ensuring all **HV/LV** and **GND** pins are correctly connected, and the car's **PWM Servo** (Steering) and **PWM Drive** (Throttle) taps are routed through the converter to $\mathbf{BCM 18}$ and $\mathbf{BCM 23}$ respectively.

2.  **Run the Script:** Since you are already in the correct project directory (`~/EDTH2025/quantum-tracer-il`), run the Python script:

    ```bash
    python3 control_interface.py
    ```

3.  **Start Driving and Observe:**

      * Turn on your $\text{RC}$ transmitter and the car.
      * The terminal should immediately start printing output like this:

| Time | STEER (Normalized) | Raw (Steering $\mu\text{s}$) | THROTTLE (Normalized) | Raw (Throttle Duty %) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 170923010.55 | $0.0000$ | $1491 \mu\text{s}$ | $0.0000$ | $0.0 \%$ |
| 170923010.57 | $0.0000$ | $1491 \mu\text{s}$ | $0.0000$ | $0.0 \%$ |
| 170923010.59 | $\mathbf{1.0000}$ | $\mathbf{1941 \mu\text{s}}$ | $0.0000$ | $0.0 \%$ |
| 170923010.61 | $\mathbf{-1.0000}$ | $\mathbf{1041 \mu\text{s}}$ | $\mathbf{0.5000}$ | $\mathbf{35.0 \%}$ |

### What to Test and Verify

While the script is running, move the steering wheel and throttle trigger to confirm the readings:

| Action | Expected Steering Output | Expected Throttle Output |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Steering Wheel Center** | Normalized: $\approx \mathbf{0.00}$ (Raw: $\approx 1491 \mu\text{s}$) | Normalized: $\mathbf{0.00}$ (Raw: $\mathbf{0.0 \%}$ Duty) |
| **Steering Wheel Full Right**| Normalized: $\approx \mathbf{1.00}$ (Raw: $\approx 1959 \mu\text{s}$) | Normalized: $\mathbf{0.00}$ (Raw: $\mathbf{0.0 \%}$ Duty) |
| **Throttle Pulled Halfway** | Normalized: $\approx \mathbf{0.00}$ (Raw: $\approx 1491 \mu\text{s}$) | Normalized: $\approx \mathbf{0.50}$ (Raw: $\\approx 35.0 % $ Duty) |

Once you see these numbers tracking your physical movements accurately, you have successfully implemented the data capture system\! You can then pipe this output to a `.csv` file alongside your camera feed to begin training your ACT policy.
